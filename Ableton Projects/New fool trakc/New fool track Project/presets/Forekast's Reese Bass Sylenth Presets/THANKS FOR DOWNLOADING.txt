Thank you for downloading my (Forekast) 6 free Reese Bass Sylenth patches/presets.

These patchces should be self explanatory on their use.  Mess around with them and learn a bit.  Have fun.

Go subscribe to my YouTube page so you can get updates on new videos, with free patches, soundsets, sample packs, and more.

Please make sure you share with other people, use creatively and
be sure to go over to my soundcloud page at

Your support and downloads mean more than anything to me.
